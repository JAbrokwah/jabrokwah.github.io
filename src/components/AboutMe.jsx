                  My name is Justin Abrokwah and I'm on this journey called life. By profession, 
                  I do {specialText("full-stack software development")} and enjoy innovation in the tech space. The problem-solving aspect of coding is my favourite thing
                  about it; there are multiple ways to do the same thing and that allows for a plethora of solutions to various problems. My career started when I
                  took an intro to CS course in grade 11 and I haven't looked back since. In 2021, I graduated from the {specialText("University of Toronto")} with an undergraduate degree in 
                  {specialText(" Computer Science")} with a {specialText("specialization in Software Engineering")}.

                  I'm planning to start my Masters journey in Fall 2024 with a focus on {specialText("Machine Learning")}. This field piques
                  my interest because of the potential of innovation it provides, and due to its ability to turn data into
                  something useful. Machine Learning is and will be an influential concept within our society.
                  <br />
                  At the moment, I'm unsure of what my end goal is but I want to equip myself as well as possible for whatever I pursue. I love to learn
                  and experiment with new techonologies and ideas, which is leading to contributing via {specialText("open-source development")} or side projects of my own
                  or with friends/colleagues.
